Summary
-------
I like to use technology (new & old) to help people solve problems. I am comfortable behind a keyboard, 
and I know what standards are and why they are important. I can create applications using a number of platforms 
and languages, and I can teach people how to use them. I can lead others, and I can follow leaders. My wide skill 
set will make me an asset to organizations of all sizes. I bring a positive attitude and a jump-in-and-get-it-done 
mentality to anything I try. I am always learning, and I am always looking for new adventures.
